Dassanayake, S., &amp; French, J. P. (2016). An improved cumulative sum-based procedure for prospective disease surveillance for count data in multiple regions. Statistics in Medicine. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.6887">https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.6887</a>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Cumulative counts are created from neighbouring areas for monitoring/detecting diseases outbreaks</li>
<li>prospective surveillance
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>decisions made at regular intervals about incidence, c.f. analysing the whole dataset retrospectively</li>
<li>so possible multiple comparisons issues?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For CUSUM-based methods, the in-control distribution can be estimated via bootstrap
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>p-values for exceeding CUSUM threshold can then be calculated</li>
<li>why p-values?</li>
<li>is this another case for going Bayesian to get posterior probabilities</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Provides discussion on <i>standard</i> Poisson CUSUM
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>parameters controlling the process are calculated via average run length (ARL)</li>
<li>ARL: desired average time between two false alarms when the process is 'in control'</li>
<li>this seems to be a difficult concept to set a limit for</li>
</ul></li>
<li>spatial CUSUM modifies counts and control parameters by a weighted average of all counts
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>weights are based on the distance between areas</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Justification for the procedure is that p-values are preferred over test statistics
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>why? surely there's a one-to-one correspondence?</li>
<li>false discovery rate is used for error control
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>this seems fine, but I'm not sure I understand the procedure fully</li>
<li>FDR = 1 - PPV, which makes that point a bit clearer</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>In the application, the authors use the first two years of data to estimate the in-control distribution
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>this is because '&#x2026; there were no unusually high disease counts reported from any of the states during this period'</li>
<li>this is clearly problematic: is this the <i>eyeball</i> test</li>
<li>the results will clearly depend on this choice, so a sensitivity analysis would be important</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I found this somewhat difficult to read overall
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>this could be due to my lack of knowledge in the area though!</li>
</ul></li>
