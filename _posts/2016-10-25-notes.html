<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Estimation of rare proportions
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>could be useful for my work</li>
<li>I wonder how many zeroes can be in the data for this method to work
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>that will be my main question at the moment</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Give the example of adverse events in clinical trials
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>here, many adverse events will have 0 counts</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Provide a toy example of estimating probabilities of height thresholds in small samples
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>expect different probabilities from different thresholds</li>
<li>clearly due to ordering of heights</li>
</ul></li>
<li>the problem with the existing methods is that they give the same interval for different thresholds
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>e.g. when when two observations fall below a threshold
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>here they have different values, but give a 0 value anyway</li>
<li>so they should have different intervals due to the different values</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>first extension is the delta method on the z-score
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>using the observed values, calculate sample mean and sd, and z-score</li>
<li>find variance of the z-score using delta method</li>
<li>then confidence interval of z-score gets transformed for the probability confidence interval</li>
</ul></li>
<li>can also be used on the cdf of z
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>this has problems with intervals though</li>
</ul></li>
<li>standard nonparametric bootstrap doesn't work
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>if you have no events, none will be in the bootstrap resamples!</li>
</ul></li>
