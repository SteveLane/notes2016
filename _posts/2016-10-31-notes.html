<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Quote that 87% of non-native terrestrial invertebrates in Europe are insects
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>whilst true, given that 80% of invertebrates are insects, it's not surprising!</li>
<li>it certainly helps their story though</li>
</ul></li>
<li>essentially a literature review
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>each study was classified by <i>reproducibility</i> &#x2014; as in, enough good information to calculate costs</li>
<li>as opposed to quality, as they say there's no objective, standard methodology for this</li>
<li>this is a good reason to develop this!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>they discuss that regional relative costs are most likely a function of research effort, as opposed to actual differences in cost</li>
<li>the costs are most likely gross underestimates
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>due to limited studies and poor coverage in under-developed countries</li>
</ul></li>
<li>total cost estimate of USD$70 billion/year</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
