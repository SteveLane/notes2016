<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Report for International EpiLab</li>
<li>Provides case studies on scenario tree modelling, so a good place to start reading in this area, even though it's a little old (2003)</li>
<li>The ultimate goal is to estimate the <i>surveillance process's sensitivity</i>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>this is the probability of detecting an infected unit, given the area is infected (under some design prevalence)</li>
<li>\(\Pr\left(\geq 1\text{ infected unit }\big|\text{ country infected}\right)\)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If there is a positive (confirmed) test on a unit, then clearly the area is not free from disease!</li>
<li>Layman's summary for scenario tree:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Combines probabilities in each step of the surveillance system to output an overall probability that the surveillance system will detect the disease if present</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For a scenario tree, they define conditional probabilities by considering preconditions
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>That is, all parent nodes to the current node</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Confidence = overall sensitivity</li>
<li>Use hypothesis testing as a framework
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Hence the <i>design prevalence</i><sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> as the <i>null</i> hypothesis</li>
<li>We then compare output based on the assumed design prevalence</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Suggest in S2.3.3 that Bayesian probabilities can be used at the end of modelling to produce a probability of freedom from disease
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>As opposed to the probability of detection as above</li>
</ul></li>
<li>All nodes in a scenario tree are <i>conditional</i> on all parent nodes</li>
<li>Unit of analysis is important
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a id="orgtarget1"></a>What happens with variable size units? E.g. crops or herds?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ordering of nodes is not important
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>as opposed to graphical models?</li>
<li>it does affect the conditional probabilities though, so keeps them easier to specify</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Factors to include are those that influence the probability of infection or detection
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>So in response to <a href="#orgtarget1">above</a>, variable sizing would need to be included somehow</li>
<li>This would then suggest for a continuous measure like crop size (e.g. in Ha), it would be better to go to a more flexible modelling tool that allows a continuous node</li>
<li>They suggest with the note, capturing variability</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Recommend stochastic modelling, with each branch probability having uncertainty in the form of an appropriate probability distribution
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>How that stochastic modelling is done is what I'm interested in mainly</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Branch probabilities
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>They say you need to use data!</li>
<li>Of course, but that's the hard part</li>
<li>Need to use data from similar diseases or geographies for a large part of this</li>
<li>Otherwise, expert opinion, which the go in to</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Surveillance systems with incomplete coverage (e.g. targeted surveillance) require two model fits
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>That using the actual data using design prevalence</li>
<li>One using a <i>representative</i> surveillance process, which uses estimated prevalence, and simulated data/units
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>With the same number of units as in the actual data</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Estimating the probability of freedom from infection is then easily done using Bayes theorem, and law of total probability</li>
<li>Sensitivity analysis should be performed
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>But doesn't say how in S2.5.2.3.8</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Provides a brief excursion into expert opinion
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Including the gathering and analysis of such data to provide node probability distributions</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Doesn't really go in to how the probabilities are traced through the tree
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I'm wondering whether this is the process:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>For any of the nodes that have a distribution attached, make a draw from them</li>
<li>Calculate the final node probabilities (for positive, i.e. infected animal) by multiplying together all of the conditional probabilities that trace to that node</li>
<li>Sum all these probabilities to produce the probability of detecting a positive animal</li>
<li>Repeat <code>nreps</code> times to give a distribution of estimates for the probability of detecting a positive animal</li>
<li>Calculate required sensitivities</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
