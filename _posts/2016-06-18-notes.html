<ul class="org-ul">
<li>this is an article about graphics in science and statistics journals</li>
<li><p>
I think graphical display of data is much easier to parse than tabled data
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>but many (applied) journals specify a maximum of figures per article!</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
a high quality graph should be able to be interpreted without elaboration
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li>Figure 1 shows a cluttered display
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I think there's a ggplot2 function to push labels apart</li>
<li>yes, here it is: <a href="https://github.com/slowkow/ggrepel">ggrepel</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Figure 2 provides a redesign
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>basically a small multiples plot</li>
<li>this is an improvement, but if the relationship is not monotone, then this figure would look a bit messy</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Figure 3 provides a scatterplot alternative
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the authors suggest that it is easy to see that average lifespan increases with education, but I find this difficult</li>
<li>I can more easily see the decrease in lifespan variation with increasing education though</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Principle 3:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Use good alignment on a common scale for quantities to be compared.
</p>
</blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>pie charts and stacked bar charts fail this principle
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>stacked bar charts because only one category (the bottom one) is aligned against the common axis</li>
</ul></li>
<li>panel plots also fail this?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The figures in the article themselves are fuzzy
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>perhaps the authors could have taken their own advice?!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Detection was found to be the main issue
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This refers to how we find out about features of the graph</li>
</ul></li>
<li>They provide a checklist at the end of the article for those producing graphics</li>
</ul>
