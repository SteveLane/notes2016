# web-skeleton

This repo holds a skeleton for subpages from my
[webpage](http://www.stephenelane.com). You could also use this as a template
for your own jekyll-based website. Clone the repo and make changes to files as
demonstrated below.

## Social and analytics

You'll need to update the social media and analytics settings. These are in the
`_config.yml` file that jekyll uses to configure your site. Change the
appropriate fields to your handles. The `analytics` field holds your google
analytics code, make sure to change this as well!

## Navigation

The skeleton has a navigation file in the `_includes` folder. This is included
in the site footer inside a `menu` class using `{% include nav.html %}`. To edit
your site navigation, edit the `_includes/nav.html` file.
